3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?


To improve the troubleshooting process, one thing to do is to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date documentation of the codebase. This documentation should include details about the program's architecture, design choices, key modules or components, and any known issues or challenges. Having this documentation readily available can provide valuable insights into the system and aid in understanding the codebase, identifying potential problem areas, and troubleshooting effectively.

Additionally, it is beneficial to adopt a systematic and organized approach to troubleshooting, documenting the steps taken, hypotheses tested, and the results obtained during the process. This helps in maintaining a clear record of the troubleshooting journey and can serve as a reference for future debugging scenarios or similar issues.
