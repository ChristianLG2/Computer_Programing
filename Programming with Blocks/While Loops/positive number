# this program asks for a positive number and until any value above 0 is enetered the program loops and repeats the same requirement. When a positive value is enetered the progam breaks and prints the positive number entered.
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if number >= 0:
        break
print("The number you entered is:", number)
